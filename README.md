Phabber
=======

Jabber bot for PHP.

Phabber cannot currently do anything at all.

Phabber will (hopefully) be an Jabber/XMPP bot built on the non-blocking React framework. It will be able to listen to notifications from third party services such as Github and broadcast these to users on a Jabber server. It will also be able to receieve commands from other Jabber users and use these to fetch information from third party services.
